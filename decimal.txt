The decimal numeral system (also called the base-ten positional numeral system, and occasionally called denary /ˈdiːnəri/[1] or decanary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.[2] The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as decimal notation
